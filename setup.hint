ldesc: "Jakarta Commons Net implements the client side of many basic 
Internet protocols. The purpose of the library is to provide fundamental 
protocol access, not higher-level abstractions. Our philosophy is to 
make the global functionality of a protocol accessible when possible, 
but also provide access to the fundamental protocols where applicable so 
that the programmer may construct his own custom implementations."
